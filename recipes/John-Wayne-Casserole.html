    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typically, you'll find that most recipes call for refrigerated biscuits or Bisquick, onions, red bell peppers, jalapeño peppers, sour cream, mayonnaise, ground beef, tomatoes, taco seasoning, and Cheddar cheese.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Biscuits: This convenient dinner starts with a can of refrigerated biscuits.</li>
    <li>Beef: You'll need a pound of ground beef for this meaty casserole.</li>
    <li>Taco seasoning: Use store-bought taco seasoning or make your own with our DIY recipe.</li>
    <li>Vegetables: Sliced onions and bell peppers are sautéed together, while sliced tomatoes are layered with the other ingredients. Jarred jalapeños, meanwhile, spice things up a bit.</li>
    <li>Sour cream and mayonnaise: A mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise is creamy, tangy, and adds tons of welcome richess.</li>
    <li>Cheese: Because isn't everything better with shredded Cheddar cheese? You could use shredded Pepper Jack if you like a little extra heat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Make the crust: Press the biscuit dough in the bottom and up the sides of a prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Cook the meat: Cook the beef until crumbly. Drain the fat, stir in seasoning and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer. Transfer the meat to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Cook the veggies: In the same pan, cook the sliced onions and peppers until tender.</li>
    <li>Make the creamy layer: Combine the sour cream, mayo, 1/2 of the Cheddar, and 1/2 of the cooked veggies in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Layer and bake the casserole: Layer the meat, tomatoes, onion-pepper mixture, jalapeños, and sour cream mixture on top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle it with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</li>
